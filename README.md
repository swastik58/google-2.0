<h1 align="center"> GOOGLE 2.0 </h1>

## A web application where you can search for anything you want just like you can do on Google

## The default search is set to Elon Musk... 
## When the page is first loaded, the results will be shown for the term 'Elon Musk"

## In the search bar, you can then type anything you wish
## You do not need to press the enter key as the rsults will be displayed automatically after you finish typing

## The button at the top right corner lets you switch the application between dark mode and light mode
